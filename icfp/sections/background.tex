\section{Background: Properties and Secure Compilers\pages{1}}\label{sec:background}

To introduce the security argument of this paper, this section defines (security) properties, their satisfaction, and their robust satisfaction (i.e., satisfaction in the presence of an active attacker; \Cref{subsec:bg:tprop}).
Then, borrowing from existing work~\cite{abate2019jour,abate2021extacc}, this section introduces secure compilers as compilers that preserve robust property satisfaction (\Cref{subsec:bg:rtp}).
