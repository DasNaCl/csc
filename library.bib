  abstract="Relational program logics are formalisms for specifying and verifying properties about two programs or two runs of the same program. These properties range from correctness of compiler optimizations or equivalence between two implementations of an abstract data type, to properties like non-interference or determinism. Yet the current technology for relational verification remains underdeveloped. We provide a general notion of product program that supports a direct reduction of relational verification to standard verification. We illustrate the benefits of our method with selected examples, including non-interference, standard loop optimizations, and a state-of-the-art optimization for incremental computation. All examples have been verified using the Why tool.",

  abstract={This paper reports the relationship between formal description of semantics (i.e., interpreter) of a programming language and an actual compiler. The paper also describes a method to automatically generate an actual compiler from a formal description which is, in some sense, the partial evaluation of a computation process. The compiler-compiler inspired by this method differs from conventional ones in that the compiler-compiler based on our method can describe an evaluation procedure (interpreter) in defining the semantics of a programming language, while the conventional one describes a translation process.},
