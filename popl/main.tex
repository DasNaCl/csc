\begin{abstract}
% To this date, no practical compiler implementation is proven as robustly safe.
% This is no surprise, since proving compilers robustly safe is a huge endeavor.
% But, compilers consist of several different passes, which themselves can be seen as compilers that translate from one intermediate representation to another.
%
% This paper investigates the compositionality of robustly safe compilers.
% Composing two compilers means to simply plug the output of one as an input to the other.
% We show that it suffices to prove individual passes as robustly safe.
% We demonstrate that one can simply prove robust memory safety preservation for one pass and prove the robust preservation of cryptographic constant time for another pass.
%
%  Robustly Safe Compilers ensure that programs that do not go wrong when linked with an arbitrary source-level attacker also do not go wrong in their compiled counterpart when linked with untrusted target-level code.
  Programs that do not go wrong should also not go wrong when linked with arbitrary, untrusted code.
  Robustly safe compilers ensure that, given such program at source level, this also holds at target level.
  The robust safety criterion requires challenging proofs which, so far, do not exist in real-world compiler implementations.
  Moreover, these implementations are modular:
  Compilers consist of several different so-called passes, which translate from one intermediate representation to another.
  It is an open question whether one can split the proof of robust safety modularily as well.

  This paper answers this question positively:
  The output of one robust safety preserving compiler may serve as input to another and this composition of both compilers remains robustly safe preserving.
  We generalise this compositional behaviour for compilers that robustly preserve different security properties.
  Thus, formal compiler engineers do not need to prove that all passes robustly preserve all security properties of interest, because their composition yields the intersection of the security properties.
  A consequence of this is that even in the context of the phase ordering problem, whenever the optimisations are proven robustly safe, we can freely swap the optimisation passes without compromising security.
  We validate our meta-level findings by means of a case study that looks at three different robust safety preserving compilers.

  Lastly, parts of our results are verified in Coq.

\section{Introduction}

\gls{cct} code does not leak information through timing analyses.
%However, it is possible to write \gls{cct} code in a more high-level language like FaCT~\cite{cauligi2019fact}.
It is folklore that programmers prefer to write code in higher-level languages such as \verb|C|.
But, high-level languages do not run on common hardware, so they need to be translated by a compiler.
Due to their optimizing nature, compilers can break security properties, such as \gls{cct}, when performing this translation.
An example of this exists in literature~\cite{barthe2018sec}:

\begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=c,caption={Before Compilation},numbers=left]
// x = (b ? x : y)
int mask = -b;
x = (y & mask) | (x & ~mask);
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=c,caption={After Compilation},numbers=left]
if(b) {
  x = y;
}
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\noindent
Here, the compiler recognizes the pattern in the bit hacks and rewrites them to code branching on \verb|b|, violating \gls{cct}.
Because of this, typically, \gls{cct} code is written in assembly.
Thanks to DSLs like FaCT~\cite{cauligi2019fact}, however, this is not necessary.

But, FaCT's compiler gives no guarantees with regards to robustness.
That is, the code may not be \gls{cct} when linked with untrusted third-party libraries.
%For example, a simple table lookup may be fetched from one of many cache layers.
%The higher up layers lead to slower access times which is detectable from just observing the program's %execution time.
%With that, an attacker can identify the entry in the table that we wanted to access.
%A \gls{cct} table lookup has to go through all elements of that table in the same order.
%
Compilers giving such a guarantee are known to be robustly preserving~\cite{abate2019jour}.
These \emph{secure compilers} give a strong formal guarantee for security, since an arbitrary target-level attacker has no chance of violating our property of interest, such as \gls{cct}.\MK{cite CCT compiler that is robustly preserving}

For code to be \gls{cct}, \gls{ms} is a prerequisite, since information is easily leaked in a memory-unsafe world by just reading out of bounds.
The importance of \gls{ms} has given rise to lots of possible countermeasures.
Particularily interesting for this paper are \emph{compiler-based} countermeasures like CETS~\cite{nagarakatte2010cets}, SoftBound~\cite{nagarakatte2009soft}, or MSWasm~\cite{michael2023mswasm}, which describes a \emph{robust enforcement} of \gls{ms}.
Given \gls{cct} requires \gls{ms}, it is natural to combine compiler-based techniques to ensure both \gls{cct} and \gls{ms} hold.
Unfortunately, the composition of secure compilers is unclear.

This paper develops the theory of secure compiler compositions and introduces a secure compilation chain for a combination of \gls{ms} and \gls{cct}.
We do this via 4 contributions:

\contribution{\contribnum Composition of Properties (\Cref{sec:compprop})}
We present a formal framework to reason about compositions of safety properties.
First, we assume there is a most general trace semantics in which a property can be defined and that there is a monitor for that property.
The monitor is defined on a restricted trace semantics without unneccessary information.
The composition of trace properties is then modelled by the composition of monitors.
The two-level approach, i.e., the two different trace semantics allow for a modular extension without touching any already existing definition.

\contribution{\contribnum Composition of Secure Compilers (\Cref{sec:compcomp})}
We introduce a formal framework for the composition of secure compilers.
Composition of secure compilers allows for modular proof engineering, since our framework can be used even if the compilers robustly preserve different properties.
A simple corollary of our main composition theorem is the fact that the composition of secure compilers with equal source and target programming lanugages can be freely swapped without compromising security.
In turn, formal compiler engineers can optimize the compilation tool chain with regards to the phase ordering problem.

\contribution{\contribnum Compiler Robustly Preserving \gls{ms} and \gls{cct} (\Cref{sec:casestud})}
We introduce a case-study consisting of three secure compilers.
To this end, we present the language $\src{L_{TMS}}$ which has a type system with linear constraints to enforce \gls{tms} statically.
%We prove that any well-typed $\src{L_{TMS}}$ program is temporal memory safe.
Then, we introduce $\trg{L}$, a language without a type system, and a compiler $\llbracket\src{\bullet}\rrbracket^{\src{L_{TMS}}\to\trg{L}}$ from $\src{L_{TMS}}$ to $\trg{L}$ that robustly preserves \gls{tms}.
To get full \gls{ms}, we define another compiler $\llbracket\trg{\bullet}\rrbracket^{\trg{L}\to\trg{L_{MS}}}$ which introduces bounds-checks and compose it with $\llbracket\src{\bullet}\rrbracket^{\src{L_{TMS}}\to\trg{L}}$.
Lastly, we define $\obj{L_{sCCT}}$, a language with access to a \emph{model specific register} to enable \gls{cct} execution, and a compiler $\llbracket\irl{\bullet}\rrbracket^{\trg{L_{MS}}\to\obj{L_{sCCT}}}$ which we compose with the other ones.
Finally, this gives us a three-step compilation chain with both \gls{ms} and \gls{cct}.


\contribution{\contribnum Coq Formalisation}
Parts of our results are formalized in the Coq proof assistant.
We use the symbol \CoqSymbol to demonstrate the fact that a definition or a proof is done in Coq.
Since our semantics and compiler definitions are extractable from Coq to Ocaml, we can run them.


We now describe the other sections in the paper.
\Cref{sec:background} establishes the notions of traces, (hyper-)properties, and robust preservation, while \Cref{sec:relwork} compares this work with others.
We conclude in \Cref{sec:concl} and give an outlook for future work.

\contribution{Open Source \& Technical Report} Our technical report and the Coq formalisation are
available as supplementary material and will be made available upon acceptance of this paper.

%\begin{lstlisting}[language=c,caption=``Wrong bounds check of two 64-bit integers.'']
%if at <= bounds {
%  x[at] = 42;
%}
%\end{lstlisting}
%Note the subtle bug of using \verb|<=| instead of \verb|<|, leading to an out-of-bounds access whenever \verb|at = bounds|.
%Furthermore, when \verb|at| and \verb|bounds| are 64-bit integers on a 32-bit architecture, the comparison may not be performed in constant-time: The compiler may bail out as soon as the lower 32 bits are unequal, not bothering to compare the higher 32 bits.
