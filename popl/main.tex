\section{Introduction}

\hltt{Context}
\hltt{Problem}

\BrText{Solution}{This paper introduces a formal framework for secure compiler compositions and showcases the framework's power by instantiating it on a multi-level compilation chain.
To this end, we discuss security property compositions and define several secure compilers, where each is either robustly preserving a different security property of interest or optimizing, i.e., applying \gls{cf} or doing \gls{dce}.
We compose these secure compilers into a multi-level compilation chain which is optimizing and robustly preserves a combination of \gls{ms} and \gls{cct}.
Crucially, the robust preservation proofs are only done for the individual compilers in the compilation chain and the robust preservation for the whole chain is a result of one of our key theorems.
The key results are formalized in Coq.}

\BrText{Validation}{In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
        \Cref{sec:compprop} presents a formal framework to reason about compositions of security properties and demonstrate its usage with concrete examples:
        Given a most general trace model, we define the trace-based security properties \gls{tms}, \gls{sms}, \gls{ms}, \gls{cct}, and their compositions.
        For each of these properties, we also give a monitor which runs on another trace model that excludes unneccessary information and show that their composition is behaviorally similar to the composition of the trace-based security properties.
        This two-level approach enhances modularity: When working with the security properties, one only needs to reason about the corresponding monitor.

  \item
        \Cref{sec:compcomp} studies different forms of secure compiler compositions.
        Concretely, it investigates upper and lower compositions, as well as the sequential composition.
        A simple corollary of sequential composition is the ability to freely reorder compiler optimizations without compromising security.

  \item \Cref{sec:casestud} sets up a case-study to demonstrate the power of our formal framework.
        We define several different languages and compilers between them and prove that the compilers are robustly preserving different properties.
        The sequential composition of these compilers yields a compilation chain that is optimizing and robustly preserving a combination of \gls{ms} and \gls{cct}.
        As for optimizations, the chain has two passes, one performing \gls{cf} and the other \gls{dce}.
        This compilation chain demonstrates the ability to perform modular proof engineering by leaveraging this paper's compositionality theorems.

  \item Our key contributions are formalized in the Coq proof assistant.
        The formalization for the compilers are \emph{extractable}.
        That is, one can translate our Coq code to Ocaml and run them.
        Finally, in this paper, whenever definitions or proofs are done in Coq, we use the symbol \CoqSymbol.
\end{itemize}}

We now describe the other sections of the paper.
In \Cref{sec:background}, the paper establishes the notions of traces, (hyper-)properties, and robust preservation, while \Cref{sec:relwork} compares this work with others.
We conclude in \Cref{sec:concl} and give an outlook for future work.

\contribution{Open Source \& Technical Report} Our technical report and the Coq formalisation are
available as supplementary material and will be made available upon acceptance of this paper.


\section{Background}\label{sec:background}
\Cref{subsec:bg:tprop} introduces trace properties, monitors, and property satisfaction.
\Cref{subsec:bg:rtp} extends the property satisfaction with robustness and shows its compiler-driven preservation, as presented in~\cite{abate2019jour}.

\subsection{Trace-Based Properties, Programming Languages, and Property Satisfaction}\label{subsec:bg:tprop}

\emph{Events} $\event$ are an abstract representation of observable actions a program can do during its execution.
Typically, one always has an empty observation $\emptyevent$ used to represent unimportant actions.
A sequence of events $\trace$ is a \emph{trace}.
So, throughout the paper, we use $\overline{\cdot}$ to mark meta-variables as sequences.
Empty sequences are denoted with $\hole{\cdot}$ and concatenation of traces $\trace[_{1}],\trace[_{2}]$ is written as $\trace[_{1}]\cdot\trace[_{2}]$.
For sake of brevity, we use this notation also for pre- and appending events to traces.

A trace-based property $\pi$ is a set of admissable traces.
For a trace to be admissable, a predicate evaluates to true whenever $\trace\in\pi$.
Classes of properties $\class$, commonly referred to as hyperproperties in literature, are sets of properties.
The \emph{lifting} of a property $\pi$ is simply its powerset and denoted as $\lift{\pi}$.
To define property satisfaction, we first look at programming languages.

For languages used in this paper, we consider a small-step style semantics.
That is, there is a step relation between states $\statevar$ and an event $\event$: $\stepto[]{\statevar[_{1}]}{\statevar[_{2}]}{\event}$.
Also, a program's syntax $p$ is encoded in the state $\statevar$ which we write as $p\in\statevar$.
For states $\statevar$, we assume there exists a judgement $\isval{\statevar}$ that determines wether $\statevar$ is a final state or not.
\Cref{fig:starstep:and:nstep}\MK{appendix?} defines the star-step relation $\stepto{\statevar[_{1}]}{\statevar[_{2}]}{\trace}$, essentially modelling a big-step style evaluation, and the $n$-step relation $\stepton{\statevar[_{1}]}{\statevar[_{2}]}{\trace}$ that evaluates a program for $n$ steps.
Both relations filter $\varepsilon$ events.

%
The \emph{behavior} of a whole program $w$ ($\behav{w}$) is a set containing all traces the program may emit during execution.
Note that for deterministic languages, $\behav{w}$ is a singleton set for any $w$.
With this, we can define satisfaction:

\begin{definition}[Property Satisfaction]\label{def:propsat}
  A \emph{whole} program $w$ satisfies $\pi$ ($\sat{w}{\pi}$) iff $\behav{w}\in\lift{\pi}$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Class Satisfaction]\label{def:classsat}
  A \emph{whole} program $w$ satisfies $\class$ ($\sat{w}{\class}$) iff $\behav{w}\in\class$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Attacker Model and Robust Trace-Property Preservation}\label{subsec:bg:rtp}

Partial programs cannot be executed, because they lack definitions for some symbols.
Providing definitions for symbols is usually the job of the \emph{linker}.
We denote linking two programs $\progvar[_{1}],\progvar[_{2}]$ as $\link{\progvar[_{1}]}{\progvar[_{2}]}$.
For sake of simplicity, we assume that linking does not fail.
With linking, we can define robust satisfaction analogously to \Cref{def:propsat,def:classsat}:

\begin{definition}[Robust Property Satisfaction]\label{def:proprsat}
  A program $\progvar$ robustly satisfies $\pi$ ($\rsat{\progvar}{\pi}$) iff for any program $\contextvar$ we have $\sat{\link{\contextvar}{\progvar}}{\pi}$. (similarily for $\rsat{\progvar}{\class}$)
\end{definition}

Robust satisfaction gives rise to a maximally powerful attacker model: Any other partial program, here referred to as context $\contextvar$, is the attacker.
So, for example, if the programming language of $\progvar$ and $\contextvar$ allows guessing of memory addresses, then $\contextvar$ is able to read and write any position in memory and therefore guess the location of secrets.

We expect compilers to preserve robust satisfaction.
In this paper, compilers are modelled as function from one programming language's syntax to the other.
Since this paper considers composing compilers, we'll adopt notation similar to tombstone diagrams to easen the formal burden.
So, we denote a compiler from $\src{L}$ to $\trg{L}$ as $\cc{\src{L}\to\trg{L}}{\src{\bullet}}$ and we refer to $\src{L}$ as \emph{source} language and to $\trg{L}$ as \emph{target} language.
Composing $\cc{\src{L}\to\trg{L}}{\src{\bullet}}$ with $\cc{\trg{L}\to\obj{L}}{\trg{\bullet}}$ is denoted as $\cc{\src{L}\to\trg{L}\to\obj{L}}{\src{\bullet}}$ and means first running $\cc{\src{L}\to\trg{L}}{\src{\bullet}}$ and plugging the output into $\cc{\trg{L}\to\obj{L}}{\trg{\bullet}}$.
Contrary to tombstones, we don't consider a compiler's implementation language.
We now define the compiler-property robust trace-property preservation.

\begin{definition}[Robust Trace-Property Preservation]\label{def:rtp}
  A compiler $\cc{\src{L}\to\trg{L}}{\src{\bullet}}$ robustly preserves a class of properties $\class$ ($\rtp{\cc{\src{L}\to\trg{L}}{\src{\bullet}}}{\class}$) iff for any property $\pi\in\class$ and $\src{p}$ written in $\src{L}$, given $\rsat{\src{\progvar}}{\pi}$, then $\rsat{\cc{\src{L}\to\trg{L}}{\src{\progvar}}}{\pi}$.
\end{definition}

Note that in the conclusion of \Cref{def:rtp} there is a target-level context.
So, programs that robustly satisfy a property are hardened against a maximally malicious environment with respect to the power of the target language.

\section{Composing Properties}\label{sec:compprop}
\Cref{subsec:propdefs} introduces a ,,most general'' trace model and defines properties (\gls{tms}, \gls{sms}, \gls{ms}, and \gls{cct}) that our case study (\Cref{sec:casestud}) uses.
By means of taking these properties as an example, \Cref{subsec:monitors} defines monitors for them and an agreement relation between a monitor's trace model with the most general trace model.
Then, we define monitor-based satisfaction and we prove that trace-property satisfaction is implied by it.
Since monitor-based satisfaction is easier to reason about, this makes our later proofs considerably simpler.

\subsection{Most General Trace-Model and Some Property Definitions}\label{subsec:propdefs}

\begin{gather*}
  \begin{aligned}
  \mi{(Security\ Tag)}~\sigma\bnfdef&\ \lock \mid \unlock\hspace{0.5cm}
  \mi{(Control\ Tag)}~\sandboxtag\bnfdef \ctx\mid\comp\\
  \mi{(Pre-event)}~\event[_{b}]\bnfdef&\ \ev{Alloc\ \loc\ n} \mid \ev{Dealloc\ \loc} \mid \ev{Use\ \loc\ n} \mid \ev{Branch\ n} \mid \ev{Binop\ n} \\
  \mi{(Event)}~\event\bnfdef&\ \emptyevent \mid \lightning \mid \event[_{b}];\sandboxtag;\sigma \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{gather*}

Security tags describe wether an event contains sensitive information ($\lock$) or not ($\unlock$).
Control tags state wether the context ($\ctx$) or the component ($\comp$) are responsible for emitting the event.
Pre-events describe the actual kind of event that happened.
$\ev{Alloc\ \loc\ n}$ states that an allocation of size $n$ happened and is stored at $\loc$.
$\ev{Dealloc\ \loc}$ announces that location $\loc$ is freed.
$\ev{Use\ \loc\ n}$ abstracts over reads from $\loc$ and writes to $\loc$ in memory, where $n$ is read/written, respectively.
$\ev{Branch\ n}$ and $\ev{Binop\ n}$ leak values involved in a branch or in a binary operation with data-dependent execution time.
Finally, events are either the emptyevent ($\emptyevent$), a program crash ($\lightning$), or a tuple consisting of a pre-event, a control tag, and a security tag.

We use this trace model to define any property that interests us.
In a sense the trace model is most general, because it abstracts all events done in our languages as defined in \Cref{sec:casestud}.
We write $\event[_{1}]\le_{\trace}\event[_{2}]$ if $\event[_{1}]$ occurs at an earlier position in $\trace$ than $\event[_{2}]$.

\gls{tms} requires that pointers are freed exactly once and that no use happens after a free.

\begin{definition}[\glsfirst{tms}]\label{def:trace:tmsdef}
  A trace $\trace$ is temporal memory safe ($\trace\in\tmssafe$) iff $\ev{Alloc\ \loc\ n;\sandboxtag;\securitytag}\le_{\trace}\ev{Dealloc\ \loc;\sandboxtag';\securitytag'}$, $\ev{Use\ \loc\ n;\sandboxtag;\securitytag}\not\le_{\trace}\ev{Alloc\ \loc\ m;\sandboxtag';\securitytag'}$ and $\ev{Use\ \loc\ n;\sandboxtag;\securitytag}\not\le_{\trace}\ev{Dealloc\ \loc;\sandboxtag';\securitytag'}$.
\end{definition}

\gls{sms} disregards out of bounds accesses.

\begin{definition}[\glsfirst{sms}]\label{def:trace:smsdef}
  A trace $\trace$ is spatial memory safe ($\trace\in\smssafe$) iff given $\ev{Alloc\ \loc\ n;\sandboxtag;\securitytag}\le_{\trace}\ev{Use\ \loc\ m;\sandboxtag';\securitytag'}$, then $n<m$.
\end{definition}

Full \gls{ms} is then described as the conjunction of \Cref{def:trace:tmsdef,def:trace:smsdef}.

\begin{definition}[\glsfirst{ms}]\label{def:trace:msdef}
  A trace $\trace$ is memory safe ($\trace\in\mssafe$) iff $\trace\in\tmssafe$ and $\trace\in\smssafe$.
\end{definition}

We define a variant of the \gls{cct} security property.
Generally, one cannot define \gls{cct} just as trace-property without, e.g., performing a self-composition of a program.
That's why we adopt for a stricter variant of \gls{cct}, called \gls{scct}, that enforces common policies to ensure code is \gls{cct}.
For example, one must not branch on secrets or perform binary operations, such as division, on secrets whose timing is data-dependent.
We opt for a definition that disregards any secrets leaked on a trace.
To define the property, we need a function on traces that strips all events with a $\lock$-tag: $\downarrow_{\lock}(\cdot)$.

\begin{definition}[\glsfirst{scct}]
  A trace $\trace$ is strictly cryptographic constant time ($\trace\in\scctsafe$) iff $\trace=\downarrow_{\lock}\left(\trace\right)$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Monitors and Trace Agreements}\label{subsec:monitors}

This subsection presents monitors for our properties of interest (\gls{tms}, \gls{sms}, \gls{ms}, \gls{scct}).
Each monitor has its own accompanying trace model that abstracts over our most general trace model.
This is because monitors should only be concerned with property-relevant information.
For each such monitor-specific trace model, we define an agreement relation that relates it with the most general trace model.
Lastly, if any monitor does not get stuck on a trace and the trace agrees with a most general trace, then the most general one satisfies the associated property of the monitor.

\section{Composing Robustly Secure Compilers}\label{sec:compcomp}
This section studies different kinds of secure compiler compositions and their corresponding proofs.
Most notably, it looks at the sequential composition of secure compilers and shows a theorem that allows for modular proof engineering: compilers need not to robustly preserve the same property in order to be securely composed.
Moreover, it demonstrates that the order does not matter for composing compilers with the same source and target language.

\section{Case Study: Memory Safe and Cryptographic Constant Time Code}\label{sec:casestud}
This section defines several secure compilers, each of which robustly preserves a different property of interest.
We demonstrate the power of our framework from \Cref{sec:compprop,sec:compcomp} by composing these compilers for a secure, but optimizing, compilation chain that robustly preserves \gls{ms} and \gls{cct}.
Concretely, \Cref{subsec:cs:tms} starts by defining languages $\src{L_{TMS}}$ and $\trg{L}$ and describes a compiler $\cc{\src{L_{TMS}}\to\trg{L}}{\src{\bullet}}$ for the robust preservation of \gls{tms} between the two languages.
\Cref{subsec:cs:ms} defines $\irl{L_{MS}}$ and a compiler $\cc{\trg{L}\to\irl{L_{MS}}}{\trg{\bullet}}$ that robustly preserves \gls{sms}.
By the framework presented in \Cref{sec:compcomp,sec:compprop}, we attain a compiler $\cc{\src{L_{TMS}}\to\irl{L_{MS}}}{\src{\bullet}}$ for the robust preservation of \gls{ms} by composing $\cc{\src{L_{TMS}}\to\trg{L}}{\src{\bullet}}$ and $\cc{\trg{L}\to\irl{L_{MS}}}{\trg{\bullet}}$.
\Cref{subsec:cs:scct} defines $\obj{L_{CCT}}$ and a compiler $\cc{\irl{L_{MS}}\to\obj{L_{CCT}}}{\irl{\bullet}}$ that robustly preserves \gls{cct}.
Composing it with $\cc{\src{L_{TMS}}\to\irl{L_{MS}}}{\src{\bullet}}$ yields $\cc{\src{L_{TMS}}\to\obj{L_{CCT}}}{\src{\bullet}}$, a compiler that robustly preserves a combination of \gls{ms} and \gls{cct}.
We attain our final compilation chain in \Cref{subsec:cs:opts}, which defines optimizing compilers performing either \gls{cf} or \gls{dce} and composes them with $\cc{\src{L_{TMS}}\to\obj{L_{CCT}}}{\src{\bullet}}$, giving us an optimizing, secure compilation chain.
