\section{Introduction}

Compilers translate from a source to a target programming language.
Despite their importance when programming and thus for day-to-day programs in general, there are fundamental gaps regarding their preservation of security.
Secure Compilation studies the preservation of security properties and hyperproperties when compiling a source to a target program.
Some existing, security-preserving compilers are fully-abstract.
That is, they reflect and preserve observational equivalence.
However, fully-abstract compilers may instrument the target code with unnecessary countermeasures not relevant for security.
Robust Compilation~\cite{abate2019} is a novel compiler property that does not require the compiler to add such unnecessary measures.
Informally, if a given (partial) source program linked with an arbitrary source context satisfies some properties of interest, so should its compiled version linked with an arbitrary target context satisfy them.
Even though there exist robust safety-property preserving compilers, they are far from practical.
Real-world compilers consist of several smaller compilers that are composed with each other in a certain way.
A prominent example would be any compiler based on the LLVM toolchain~\cite{lattner04}, whose optimization pipeline consists of many passes, which one can view as independent compilers composed to achieve speedups.
To the best of our knowledge, current work does not discuss which properties are preserved by compilers that use other compilers in their pipeline.

This talk will investigate how different compiler compositions preserve properties, given that the compilers involved in the composition fulfil certain assumptions.
We define classes of hyperproperties and identify their lattice.
We prove that our chosen compositions preserve at least the least upper bound within the lattice of such classes.
Consequently, the order of optimizations in a compilation pipeline does not matter for property preservation, assuming that each such pass preserves the class of interest.

\section{Section II}

\begin{definition}[Classes]
  A class of hyperproperties $\cC$ is a set of hyperproperties.
\end{definition}
\noindent
From now on, we use $\Pi$ for elements of any class $\cC$.
\noindent
\begin{definition}[Programming Languages]\label{def:pl}
A programming language is a tuple $\left(\partials,\wellf,\singlestep,\linker\right)$ s.t.:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[$\partials$] : Set - is a set of admissible, partial programs.
  \item[$\wellf$] : $\partials$ - a judgement that holds iff a program is not partial.
  \item[$\singlestep$] : $\wholes\to\events\to\wholes$ - a step relation, where $\wholes=\{w\in\partials\ |\ \wellf w\}$.
        For $e\in\events$ and $p,p'\in\wholes$ we say for $\estep{p}{e}{p'}$ that program $p$ performs a step with action $e$ to program $p'$.
        If $e=\emptyevent$, we write $\step{p}{p'}$.
        $\terminationevent$ is the termination event.
  \item[$\linker$] : $\partials\to\partials\to\partials$ - links two partial programs together in some way, resulting in a new partial program.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Traces]
  A trace $\trace$ is an infinite sequence of events that results from the relation $\singlestep$.
  That is, we obtain the trace $\trace=\seqcons{e_{0}}{\seqcons{e_{1}}{\dots}}$ for the execution sequence $\estep{p}{e_{0}}{\estep{p'}{e_{1}}{\dots}}$ and write $\mktrace{p}{\trace}$.
  The set of all traces is $\traces$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Behavior]
  The behavior of a whole program $p$ is a set of all traces it produces, i.e. $\behav{p}=\{\trace\ |\ \mktrace{p}{\trace}\}$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Hyperproperties]
  A hyperproperty $H$ is a set of admissible sets of traces. Thus, if $p$ satisfies $H$ (written $\sat{p}{H}$), then $\behav{p}\in H$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Robust Property Satisfaction]
  A program $p$ robustly satisfies a hyperproperty $\Pi$, written $\rsat{p}{\Pi}$, iff $\forall C\in\partials,\sat{C\linker p}{\Pi}$. The same notation is used for robust hyperproperty satisfaction.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}[Property Satisfaction Refinement]
  For a property $\prop$ that refines $\prop'$, i.e. $\prop\subseteq\prop'$, if any $p\in\partials$ satisfies $\sat{p}{\prop'}$, then $\sat{p}{\prop}$.
\end{lemma}


\begin{definition}[Compilers]
  A compiler between languages $\S$ and $\T$ is a partial function $\stcomp{\bullet}$ from $\src{\partials}$ to $\trg{\partials}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Robust Trace-Hyperproperty Preservation]\label{def:rtp}
  For a given class $\cC$, a compiler from languages $\S$ to $\T$ robustly preserves $\cC$ iff
  $$
  \forall\Pi\in\cC,\forall\src{p}\in\src{\partials},\rsat{\src{p}}{\Pi}\implies\rsat{\stcomp{\src{p}}}{\Pi}
  $$
  We write $\rtp{\stcomp{\bullet}}{\cC}$.
\end{definition}
\noindent
We can, finally, discuss various forms of compositions.
We begin with the most straightforward one, which coincides with ordinary function composition.
From a practical perspective, this means plugging the result of one compiler into another one.
Such pipelines happen when optimizing source code, so at the level of a suitable intermediate representation, but also on a higher level:
Consider as an example a typical TypeScript compilation pipeline.
First, it translates TypeScript code to JavaScript, which V8 compiles to Ignition bytecode that, after some runtime-performance analysis, is just-in-time compiled via TurboFan to machine code such as x86.

\begin{definition}[Sequential Composition of Compilers]
  Given two compilers $\sicomp{\bullet}$ and $\itcomp{\bullet}$, their sequential composition is $\sitcomp{\bullet}=\itcompN{\sicomp{\bullet}}$.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}[Weakening RTP]\label{lem:weaken}
  Given classes $\cC_{1}, \cC_{2}$ such that $\cC_{1}\subseteq\cC_{2}$ and $\rtp{\stcomp{\bullet}}{\cC_{2}}$, it holds that $\rtp{\stcomp{\bullet}}{\cC_{1}}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}[Sequential Composition with RTP]\label{lem:seqcompo}
  Given $\rtp{\sicomp{\bullet}}{\cC_{1}}$ and $\rtp{\itcomp{\bullet}}{\cC_{2}}$, then $\rtp{\sitcomp{\bullet}}{\cC_{1}\cap\cC_{2}}$.
\end{lemma}

We now consider a compiler that invokes two other compilers.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the most obvious example of such a composition.
One writes down some code of any of these three languages embedded in the same file, but different compiler toolchains process them.

\begin{definition}[Upper Composition]
  Given two compilers $\stcomp{\bullet}$ and $\itcomp{\bullet}$, their upper composition is

  $$\uhcsitcomp{\bullet}=\lambda p.\begin{cases}\stcomp{p} &\text{if }p\in\src{\partials}\\
                                                \itcomp{p} &\text{if }p\in\irl{\partials}\end{cases}$$.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}[Upper Composition with RTP]
  Given $\rtp{\stcomp{\bullet}}{\cC_{1}}$ and $\rtp{\itcomp{\bullet}}{\cC_{2}}$, then $\rtp{\uhcsitcomp{\bullet}}{\cC_{1}\cap\cC_{2}}$.
\end{lemma}

With the same idea, we define a dual composition that goes from a single source language to multiple target languages.
Any compiler used in production is defined that way since one can, as an example, compile C code to both x86 and MIPS assembly.
We view frameworks such as RubyOnRails also as an example that can emit two different target languages, in this case, HTML and JS, at once.
\begin{definition}[Lower Composition]
  Given two compilers $\stcomp{\bullet}$ and $\sicomp{\bullet}$, their lower composition is $\lhcsitcomp{\bullet}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Lower Composition with RTP]
  Given $\rtp{\stcomp{\bullet}}{\cC_{1}}$ and $\rtp{\sicomp{\bullet}}{\cC_{2}}$, then $\rtp{\lhcsitcomp{\bullet}}{\cC_{1}\cap\cC_{2}}$.
\end{lemma}

Using the upper and lower composition, we may end up with a diamond situation, which the following lemma describes.
Especially from a security researcher perspective, the diamond lemma is attractive as it says that there is no harm to prove compiler passes robust property preserving in a modular way.
That is, consider some program instrumented against SPECTRE v1 attacks and, in parallel to that, against SPECTRE v4.
If the compiler instrumentation for v1 does not violate v4, the lemma tells us that combining both instrumentations in some way yields an instrumentation that protects against both v1 and v4.

\begin{lemma}[Diamond]\label{lem:diamond}
  Given $\rtp{\lhcsiocomp{\bullet}}{\cC_{1}}$ and $\rtp{\uhciotcomp{\bullet}}{\cC_{2}}$ with $\stcomp{\bullet} = \lambda\src{p}.\uhciotcomp{\lhcsiocomp{p}}$, then $\rtp{\stcomp{\bullet}}{\cC_{1}\cap\cC_{2}}$.
\end{lemma}

The following free theorem is a direct consequence of \Cref{lem:seqcompo} where the involved compilers' input and output are both partial programs in the same language.
Given that some set of optimization passes is robustly preserving properties, we can combine them in an arbitrary order and preserve the same least upper bound.
A compilers optimization pipeline ordering is difficult and often hand-tuned.
The lemma allows us to not care about the particular order of optimizations regarding their robust property preservation.
So, the compiler developer is free to swap around.
\begin{lemma}[Swappable]
  Given $\rtp{\ttcomp{\bullet}_{(1)}}{\cC_{1}}$ and $\rtp{\ttcomp{\bullet}_{(2)}}{\cC_{2}}$, then $\rtp{\ttcompN{\ttcomp{\bullet}_{(2)}}_{(1)}}{\cC_{1}\cap\cC_{2}}$ and $\rtp{\ttcompN{\ttcomp{\bullet}_{(1)}}_{(2)}}{\cC_{1}\cap\cC_{2}}$.
\end{lemma}
\MK{This shouldn't work with relational hyperproperties, right?}

\section{Conclusion}

We presented some practically relevant compiler compositions and their respective implications for security.
Furthermore, compiler developers need not worry about optimization order constraints if the involved optimizations are proven to preserve properties of interest robustly.
